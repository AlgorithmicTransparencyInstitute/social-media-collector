// TODO: in some cases, I suspect, FB may switch to having obfuscated sponsor labels that

//       attribute, pointing to an element elsewhere in the DOM tree (not in the ad element)
//       that contains the unobfuscated text "Sponsored." So, we should account for that
//       somehow, perhaps by finding all elements with a labelledby attr, seeing if they
//       point to something that says "Sponsored" and, if so, considering anything that
//       is labeled by that element to be an ad.
